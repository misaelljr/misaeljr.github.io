# Hello World

<p align="justify"> Recently I created this blog as an alternative to broadcast the work in which I am involved. Furthermore, I intend to use this space as a means of sharing knowledge such as programming languages, APIs and results obtained through the work developed.</p>

<p align="justify"> At first, I thought to write only in English. I apologize for the errors in written in English :).</p>

<p align="justify"> I'm making links available for access to my profiles on social networks, as well as my <a href="https://github.com/misaelljr/">Github account</a>. I would be extremely grateful to receive suggestions and partnerships for the development of my work or others.</p>

<p align="justify"> For more information, please follow the <a href="https://misaelljr.github.io/sobre/">"About" page</a>.</p>
