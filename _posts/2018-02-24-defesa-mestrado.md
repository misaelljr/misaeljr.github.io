<p align="justify"> I admit that this was the first song I thought of when I heard from my advisor that I had been approved by the bench :) </p>

<p align="justify">It was about 3 years of hard work to finish the master's degree. So, my friends, it was not easy. Anyway, it was the greatest <b> LEARNING </b> of my life. Know that something that you researched, developed and solved (not so much) was "graced" and praised by the group, is inestimable. The days before the defense of the master's degree was a true movie, sometimes of terror and other times of drama. It was very interesting to be able to evaluate the situations that I passed from the beginning of the master's degree until arriving at that moment of the defense. This reminds me of the moments in the beginning of the master's degree when I asked myself, "What am I doing here?" And today I reply to myself: "This is exactly where I should be."</p>

<p align="justify">During the MSc, I worked with automation of test oracles for systems that process three-dimensional medical images of blood vessels. Soon I will add the URL to access my dissertation. However, I already have the <a href="https://misaelljr.github.io/images/slides_defesa.pdf">slides</a> used in the master's defense.</p>

<p align="justify">The photo below was taken moments after the approval of the defense with the following teachers who made up the bank:</p>
