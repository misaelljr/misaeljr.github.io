<p align="justify"> On June 30, I had the opportunity to talk with the children's who are part of the Children's Police of the Military Police (PM) of the city of Avelino Lopes, in the south of the state of Piaui (PI). Children's Police is part of a project "idealized" by the government of the PI and by the PM. </p>

<p align="justify"> During the conversation with the children, I talked about a variety of topics: my childhood, my experience in Children's Police, what I learned in my Children's Police, and my professional choice. In addition, I talked to them about the Internet. </p>

<p align="justify">In addition to the issues mentioned above, I talked to the children and asked for their opinion on the subjects of the talk, which made me understand their point of view and also learn from them. The city of Avelino Lopes in the extreme south of Piaui is a small city, where rural activity predominates. In addition, it is a city where drug trafficking, prostitution and domestic violence predominate. Finally, they are children who are in an environment of risk and the Children's Police gives the opportunity of these children to seek a new way in life, different than most of the city's children.</p>

<p align="justify">I hope, soon, to return to Avelino Lopes and talk more with the children. Also, I'm working on more subjects that might be of interest to them, such as fake new and smarrphone usage in everyday life.</p>
