<p align="justify"> I am MSc in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics (PPG-CCMC) from the <b><a href="http://www.icmc.usp.br/">Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (ICMC) of the University of Sao Paulo (USP)</a></b> with the guidance of <b><a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/2844974351441051">Prof. Dr. Márcio Delamaro (advisor)</a></b>, developing investigations and studies in Software Engineering.</p>

<p align="justify">During the master's degree, I worked with automation of test oracles developing evaluation approaches for systems that process medical images in three-dimensional models. Test oracles are methods that judge whether the output of a system under testing is in accordance with the expected output. The work is inserted in the area of Software Testing and was finalized in 2017. =) </p>

<p align="justify">I graduated in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the <b><a href="http://www.uespi.br/site/">State University of Piaui (UESPI)</a></b>between 2010-2014. During graduation, I did SI (Scientific Initiation) in Internet of Things, developing solutions, theoretical and practical, for the remote monitoring of people with special medical needs and continuous care. During SI, I developed algorithms for detecting falls in patients being treated.</p>
